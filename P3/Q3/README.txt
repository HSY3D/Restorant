NOTE TO TA:

Q3 works but we had a problem with the GUI (error: no X11 variable display was set)

There are still some bugs in Engine.java and Gaby Di is taking full responsibility for any penalties in this portion of the project.

Please allow us to keep updating it until complete.

We are making a console I/O and we'll keep that version up.

UPDATE:

We have completed the console I/O, because the GUI did not work. It has been uploaded.
